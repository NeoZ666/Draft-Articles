# **The Man, The Bureaucracy, The Internet and Bitcoin**

There are 2 definitions to Bureaucracy.

Bureaucracy, as a system of administration, emerged as human societies became more complex and needed efficient ways to manage resources, regulate activities, and maintain order. Its development can be traced back to the rise of early civilisations and the growth of centralised states, as these societies faced increasing demands for coordination and organization. 

Bureaucracy is the silent conqueror of civilizations. It does not seize power through revolution, war, or economic domination. Instead, it infiltrates, expands, and slowly consumes the very ruling classes it once served. No matter who rules—priests, warriors, merchants, or secret police—bureaucracy latches onto the system like a parasite, feeding off its power while offering the illusion of order and efficiency. It's a hidden cost that the masses have to pay to be under the disguise of this illusion, by their freedoms, sweat and blood.

I want to argue both are true. Or 'were'. Because as of 2025, we are definitely closer to the latter than the former.

So, at the start of the Bureaucracy, various ruling classes presided over their societies, they came into power due to various external and internal factors including, but not limited to the Geography, Culture, Resource Availability, Complexity of the Civilisation and Competition, this is nicely detailed in a later section by Niccolò Machiavelli. These ruling classes supplanted their characteristic on Society in different ways. This is the primary reason for the demarcations of different human civilisations in the pre-modern age. These ruling classes included: 

**Default Ruling Classes:**  
- The Priest / The Intellectual Class  
- The Warrior Nobility  
- The Merchant Class  

**Transitional Ruling Classes:**  
- The Nomad Elites  
- The Peasantry  

**Emergent Ruling Classes:**  
- The Secret Police  
- The Hybrid

# **How Power Structures Shape Ruling Classes**

Power and ruling classes are intertwined, each shaping and reinforcing the other. As power structures shift, so too do the elites who hold control. From the priestly intellectuals of the past to the secret police of the modern era, each ruling class aligns with a particular type of power—whether it be ideological, economic, military, or informational.

---

## **The Default Ruling Classes**

### **The Priest / Intellectual Class – The Architects of Ideology**

At the heart of civilization lies ideology—the stories we tell ourselves about power, legitimacy, and the right to rule. Priests and intellectuals have historically controlled this narrative, shaping the moral and philosophical foundations of their societies.

In medieval Europe, the Church was not just a religious institution; it was a pillar of governance. It controlled education, dictated laws, and justified the rule of kings through divine right. Even in secular societies, intellectual elites—university professors, philosophers, and media figures—hold tremendous sway by shaping public discourse.

The intellectual class dominates through **ideological power**—they define what is acceptable, what is taboo, and what is unthinkable. In modern times, they manifest as think tanks, universities, and the media, exerting power over what people believe and, by extension, how they behave.

_Example: Sumerian City States, the ruling governor or king came from the line of Priests and also held the rank of the Head Priest, also known as "Ensi" at Lagash. Brahmins in Ancient India._

This essentially leads to a Theocratic Authoritarianism if taken to the extreme.

### **The Warrior Nobility – The Enforcers of Violence**

Where ideology constructs the framework of power, violence enforces it. The warrior nobility—whether feudal knights, samurai, or generals—have historically wielded political power through military dominance. They are the lions of Machiavelli’s dichotomy: rulers who maintain order through force.

During times of instability, the warrior class often seizes direct control. However, in stable societies, they tend to be subservient to the ideological elite. Modern military leaders rarely take power outright, as they are ideologically conditioned to see themselves as defenders of the state rather than its rulers. This shift marks the transition from lion-led societies to fox-led ones, where controlled violence serves the interests of the bureaucratic and ideological elite.

_Example: Franco's Spain, Modern Day Myanmar._

This essentially leads to a Military Junta or a Right Wing Coalition Authoritarianism if taken to the extreme.

### **The Merchant Class – The Masters of Money**

Money is a peculiar form of power—it can influence, but it is also dependent on external conditions. The merchant class, rising to prominence in the late medieval and early modern periods, thrives in societies where commerce is prioritised over military conquest or religious orthodoxy. They also gain prominence in peace times where chaos isn't as big of a factor.

In capitalist societies, the merchant class becomes dominant by leveraging **financial power**—controlling resources, production, and access to economic prosperity. However, wealth alone does not always translate to ultimate control. While capitalists influence policy through lobbying, media ownership, and philanthropy, they often remain secondary to those who control ideology.

In the modern world, billionaires fund politicians and media networks, but their power is often contingent on public perception. If the ideological elites turn against them, they can be brought down through regulation, social movements, or public scandal. This shows the limits of financial power when pitted against ideological control.

_Example: The British East India Company, Italian City States - Venice and Genoa._

This essentially leads to a Corporatokracy, not to be confused with Corporatism if taken to the extreme. Against mainstream thought, I don't think this is the end of Austrian Economics.

## **The Transitional Ruling Classes**

### **The Nomad Elites – The Disruptors of Stability**

Nomadic elites emerge during periods of upheaval—barbarians at the gates, warlords in power vacuums, or revolutionary leaders reshaping the system. They are the great **disruptors of civilization**, often using raw violence or opportunistic alliances to rise to power.

Historically, figures like the Mongols, the Bedouins, or the Cossacks exemplify this ruling class. They capitalize on periods of collapse, stepping into power vacuums left by failing institutions. Their rule, however, is often temporary—eventually, they either assimilate into the existing power structure or are replaced by more stable governance.

In modern times, nomadic elites could be seen in decentralized groups like terrorist organizations, insurgencies, or cybercriminal networks—entities that challenge the existing order but struggle to sustain long-term rule.

### **The Peasantry – The Accidental Rulers**

Rarely does the peasantry rule, but in moments of extreme crisis, they can rise to power. Peasant revolts, communist revolutions, and grassroots uprisings are examples of moments where the lower classes briefly seize control.

However, power gained through mass movements is often unstable. The peasantry lacks longterm institutional experience, making them susceptible to co-optation by ideological elites, military leaders, or bureaucratic administrators. The French Revolution, for instance, began as a peasant uprising but quickly fell under the control of the Jacobins and later Napoleon. The Vanguard, led by the far left institutional class, quickly sought to consolidate power away from the peasants and had turned into a complete psychotic police state after Stalin got the reins of the state.

In modern politics, populist movements reflect this dynamic—while they claim to represent the common people, they are often guided by charismatic leaders who manipulate ideology for their own ends.

---

## **The Emergent Ruling Classes (The Good, The Bad)**

### **The Secret Police – The Masters of Information and Fear**

As societies become more bureaucratic and surveillance-driven, power shifts from visible rulers to those who control information. The secret police—whether in totalitarian states or through modern surveillance agencies—exemplify this shift.

Information power is distinct from ideological power—it is not about shaping belief but controlling behavior through **covert coercion**. The secret police don’t need to convince you of an ideology; they only need you to fear the consequences of dissent.

From the KGB to the Nazis, from intelligence agencies to corporate data surveillance, the new ruling class emerges not from the battlefield or the marketplace but from the ability to monitor, predict, and manipulate public actions.

The Secret Police State tries to end all manners of traditional institutions that formed the base for the traditional ruling classes—i.e., the Soviet Union tried to destroy the Family, the Church, Free Trade & Natural Rights, Culture and Heritage in order to remove the semblance of any past. The Left will say it's necessary to do so because, "All these institutions are inherently oppressive," when the real motive for the Secret Police State is to make sure that Society can never go back to its default, natural setting. This is the most dangerous of all, and the seeds of cultural Marxism, critical theory, and social justice all lead to the same place. They are the ones that Orwell's *1984* warns us of.

Here, there is no end goal. It's already here, and you wouldn't even know it. The dissenters will be vanquished, the protests will not be visible, the words will be removed, and rights will continue to be curtained until there's none left—until there's no humanity, only replaceable cogs for the machine.

### **The Hybrid – Bureaucracy Is the Decadence of a Good System**

Modern states and corporations are no longer ruled by individuals, but by **institutional processes.** Politicians come and go, CEOs rise and fall, but the bureaucratic machine remains. It is self-replicating, self-sustaining, and largely immune to traditional forms of overthrow.

In a sense, bureaucracy **transcends ruling classes**—it is the **final parasite,** outlasting kings, generals, priests, and merchants. It does not need a face, a name, or an ideology. It simply expands, consumes, and perpetuates itself.

_Example: The modern administrative state, where elected officials often have less power than unelected bureaucratic institutions that dictate policy._

# **All Progress Is Not Good Progress**
 
So far, we have looked at the transition of power across history and civilisations. This is to drive the point home that bureaucracy has existed, but has gotten worse towards the up-and-coming Emergent Ruling Classes—with Secret Police and the degeneracy of the once-powerful 'hybrid system' taking the cake. With more surveillance tools and subversion of the Institutional Structures that have held up Humanity since its inception; i.e., the conversion of:

> Religion into Political Ideology  
> Culture into Critical Theory  
> Education into Propaganda  
> Community into the Lone Individual  
> Economy into a Game  
> Emotional Relationships into Transactions

...have led to serious social problems for all of us: be it skyrocketing depression, loneliness crisis, or people not being able to make ends meet—where money is no longer a means to something more in life, but rather the end itself. The conversion of human relationships into something purely transactional and shallow, the rise of inceldoom and gender and race wars—all have been propped by the bureaucracy in the modern world to fulfill their need to create the perfect 'Coomsumer', one who doesn't question "why do we need you," void of any self-authority, self-integrity, nor community, race, or religion; no friendship or love or otherwise, because god-forbid if you try to find happiness in anything other than endless consumption. All this, to make sure that the masses can never even think of rising against Big Brother, the maintenance of the Neo Liberal Status Quo, and yes, for us to just CONSUME. This is awfully close to Friedrich Nietzsche's Last Man, characterised by passive nihilism and a lack of higher aspirations, ultimately serving the interests of a consumer-driven system that discourages critical examination of authority.

The only logical solution is to fight to take them back. The "March Towards Institutions"—to rekindle the fire of the spirit and not to run away from the problem. This is very prevalent among the American "Don't Tread on Me" crowd, who might fear government overreach and think that moving away from the institutions of power—which are generally centred in cities—is the solution. It is not. Antithetically, when we lay down our weapons and tools, we make it easy for our abductors to abuse our rights. For example, California has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, including mandatory waiting periods, background checks, and restrictions on certain firearm types. Rural residents, who often use firearms for hunting and personal protection, have expressed that these laws impose unnecessary burdens and fail to consider the cultural significance of guns in rural communities. So did the government care that they moved away from them? No. They don't. They came regardless.

In India, the middle class is similarly demarcated along several social, regional, religious, and cultural lines, hence holding no voting bloc of their own—a necessity in despotic Third World countries—thus never driving change, driving nothing that benefits them, but only a "form of progress" that takes more and more from them. Similarly, aforementioned issues take precedence for the intellectual classes in India because that's what garners the most attention and craze, drives the emotions, sets the narrative, and elects governments.

If this has to change, the people have to capture the institutions first and foremost, to kick out the parasitic class masquerading as public servants, and change priorities to drive change. This endeavour is arduous—an uphill battle—but it's paramount to end the reign of the false gods. This can only be achieved when we have a two-fold strategy of:  
1. The **Esoteric**: Driving change to fix the social problems of our time by leveraging traditions which did work for the inherent human condition before being destroyed by the powers that be.  
2. The **Material**: Driving change to fix the social problems of our time by leveraging technology in the realms of economy, administration, and privacy protection.

Among most people who correctly identify these problems of our time, they generally hate technology for the role it plays in it—somewhat, rightfully so. But as I explain, we have to be "accelerationist" in some sense of the word to have a shot at this. Just identifying the problem is not enough. We need progress—this time, in the right direction.

# **The Social Parasite: The Hidden Class of Extraction**

Every society is a delicate balance between those who create and those who consume. At the heart of this balance lies the **host-to-parasite ratio (HPR)**—the unseen measure of a civilization’s health. When the number of productive individuals, or **hosts**, outweighs the number of **parasites**, society thrives. When the parasites begin to overtake the hosts, decline sets in.

The **Social Parasite** is not just an economic freeloader—it is a broader category of individuals who take more from society than they give, whether through corruption, crime, or ideological manipulation. These are not simply the poor or unemployed, nor are they merely criminals. A parasite, by definition, is **not just someone in need, but someone who feeds off the system while actively contributing to its decay**.

### **Mexico: A Nation of Hosts and Parasites**

Mexico provides a textbook example of this dynamic. On one side, we see the **hardworking Mexican worker**, logging some of the longest hours in the world, deeply family-oriented, and contributing to an energetic and resilient culture. These are the **hosts**—the people who sustain society despite adversity.

On the other side, we find **the parasites**—not just the infamous drug cartels but also corrupt politicians, bureaucratic leeches, and cultural figures who normalize and glorify parasitic behavior. A striking example is the popularity of **narcocorridos**, folk songs that celebrate cartel life, spreading the idea that crime and parasitism are not only viable life paths but admirable ones.

The result? A country that **never collapses but never reaches its full potential**, constantly locked in a battle between its hosts and its parasites.

### **The Evolution of Parasitic Classes**

Social parasites adapt to the conditions of their societies. In some cases, they manifest as **ideological parasites**, shaping cultural values to excuse or glorify their existence. In others, they take on the form of **economic parasites**, siphoning wealth through corruption or manipulation.

But no matter their form, they share a common trait: they **do not contribute to the survival or success of their society but extract from it**. And if left unchecked, they eventually tip the balance—leading to a society where production declines, social trust erodes, and stagnation takes hold.

## **What to Do?**

Today, we stand at a place where the world is increasingly more chaotic every day; history's moving too fast—curbing of our rights, wars, technological advancements, and brain rot. Essentially, it's becoming difficult for the people and the parasites to deal with it. In our cultures, particularly in many Eastern cultures, chaos is an enemy that must be defeated and tamed, that order must be derived at all costs, and **uncertainty is something to be feared, not an opportunity to learn and progress to be seized.** No doubt, in the last 80–100 years of peace in the West, the inoculation of Cultural Marxism in all institutions and in the psyche of the masses has taught everyone to give up their freedoms for the sake of this "order" and "common good." It's starting to reach a tipping point and it shows. There are cracks in the "Rules Based Order"—i.e., a psyop by globalist forces to extend and legitimise their bureaucracy on all of us in the realm of global geopolitics.

At the time of this writing, Romania's right-wing party has been banned and barred from elections by the bureaucracy—a party with 40% national support banned by the bureaucratic puppets whose ringmasters are sipping champagne in Davos (WEF) and Brussels (EU). You have Italy, where the mandate of the president elected by her peoples is being limited by the supranational entity of the EU. 

You have India, where a so-called right-wing nationalist government cannot be fiscally responsible; it only removes power away from existing decentralised structures (including religious ones, which it claims to protect) by overextending its surveillance state, by centralising more control every year, and by bringing in draconian laws that do not care about the rights and liberties of its citizenry as mandated by Sections 14 and 15 of the Constitution. What is so 'conservative' or 'right-wing' about this? As someone has said, "BJP is just Congress with cows." Must ring true for all Gujaratis now that `Mota Bhai` has access to all your data on your so-called encrypted social media, in the name of taxation. Make it make sense.  
 
The examples are endless and the frogs are starting to notice the brimming, boiling water. The bureaucracy, as we know it today, is an artificial construct existing only because of a healthy amount of hosts partaking in their game. We have to tip this balance to bring change. Each man checking out of the system is a lower HPR, lowering the health of the civilisation, accelerating the change in the overtone window (I am going to discuss this in the next article), and increasing the propensity to bring improvements by organised communities like ourselves. 

There are different strategies to deal with the three enemies within the masses themselves (the faithless bourgeoisie, the incessant decadent, and the disposables) that we will learn more about later as we go along this crusade to cleanse our civilisation and break the cycle. 

Right now, let's talk about something more personal and within our capacity to understand and work on. You should have this question: "Neo, if we remove bureaucracy, in the ensuing chaos, won't it be replaced by the same thing?" For most eras, the answer would be yes. However, today, we have extremely appropriate and, frankly, divine material conditions to start taking consistent efforts to build away from this cesspool. Most people are sheep, but we must be better. That's the divine mandate given to the masculine by our gods. 

The answer for our era is a resounding "No." Go back to the first paragraph of this piece, and in the first definition, the words I have used are carefully adapted to conjure up an entity that can effectively work upon the initial purpose of bureaucracy in a non-corruptible manner; i.e., the Cypherpunk movement, the Internet, and Freedom Tech can be the shot we need.

The Internet gives us the means to communicate and make community-driven decisions without the need for a faceless bureaucracy trying to relay messages (often times, skewing said messages). It can be a place of genuine debate where good ideas win and bad ones are rightfully trashed, unlike our current system where incompetence and mess-ups are rewarded at the peril of someone else's freedom and/or money. 

Then, you have the Cypherpunk Movement, which is basically a digital rebellion against bureaucratic decay. This is a new force that has emerged, challenging this decaying structure. It's born from the belief that **privacy, decentralisation, and cryptographic tools can empower individuals**. The Cypherpunk movement offers more than just digital privacy—it provides the foundation for a new way of organising society, one that **eliminates the need for bureaucratic middlemen and enables rapid, transparent decision-making via the Internet**.

## **The Cypherpunk Vision: Replacing Bureaucracy with Digital Autonomy**

The **core problem** with bureaucracy is its nature as a **centralized bottleneck**. Every decision, from permits to policies, must pass through layers of slow-moving officials, each adding friction, delay, and often corruption. Cypherpunks propose an alternative: **using cryptographic systems to create trustless, decentralized decision-making networks**.

Rather than relying on bureaucrats to verify and enforce rules, cryptographic tools allow **automated, tamper-proof systems** that work without a central authority. This is already happening in:

- **Nostr:** A simple, open protocol enabling decentralized, censorship-resistant social media.
- **Smart Contracts:** Agreements that execute automatically based on predefined conditions, eliminating the need for regulatory oversight.
- **Bitcoin:** Effectively a non-inflatable currency, backed by the energy production capabilities of our civilisation, held up by the community.
- **Coinswap:** Bitcoin transaction's privacy capabilities can be drastically improved with Coinswap.
- **Reticulum:** A low-level mesh networking protocol designed for resilient, decentralized communication, especially when traditional Internet infrastructure fails.
- **Decentralized Governance (DAOs):** Online organizations where members vote directly on proposals, bypassing traditional bureaucratic layers.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** A way to verify information (like identity or eligibility) without revealing sensitive data, reducing paperwork and fraud.
- **Tor Network:** Tor facilitates anonymous web browsing by directing Internet traffic through a worldwide overlay network, concealing users' locations and usage from surveillance and traffic analysis.
- **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard):** A cryptographic tool for secure communication, enabling users to encrypt data and create digital signatures.
- ...and much, much more.

By **automating trust**, Cypherpunk technology replaces bureaucratic inefficiency with **real-time, transparent decision-making**.

How so? Cypherpunk technologies, such as Nostr, smart contracts, Bitcoin, Coinswap, Reticulum, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Zero-Knowledge Proofs, the Tor Network, and GNU Privacy Guard (GPG), collectively challenge traditional bureaucratic systems by picking apart every function that it could have done. These innovations emphasize open-source development with permissive licenses, ensuring transparency and collaborative improvement. Features like self-hostability empower users to control their data, while the use of cryptographic public keys as user identifiers enhances security and privacy. Local-first applications operate without Internet dependency, promoting resilience and user sovereignty. The principle of credible exit allows users to seamlessly transfer their data across platforms, reducing vendor lock-in. Self-authenticity ensures data integrity through cryptographic signatures, eliminating the need for centralized verification. Collectively, these technologies and principles dismantle bureaucratic inefficiencies, thus fostering a more autonomous and transparent digital ecosystem.

For example, bureaucratic control over monetary systems has historically facilitated the expansion of fiat currencies, central bank mismanagement, and the bailing out of corporations at the dime of the taxpayer, leading to inflationary pressures, economic instability, and a breakdown of trust. Central banks, often influenced by political agendas, can increase the money supply without corresponding economic growth, resulting in currency devaluation—thus making everyone poorer over time, excluding those closest to power. Economist Murray Rothbard criticized this practice, equating excessive money creation to "legalized counterfeiting" and advocating for a return to the gold standard to maintain monetary integrity.

We talked about 3 problems posed by the traditional central banking system. Freedom Tech like Bitcoin fixes these, propped up by the bureaucratic interventionist powers, and offers a community-based alternative:
- **Fixed Supply:** Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins, preventing arbitrary expansion and protecting against inflation.
- **Community Driven:** Operating on a peer-to-peer network without central authority, Bitcoin reduces the potential for bureaucratic manipulation of the currency.
- **Transparency:** All transactions are recorded on a public ledger (blockchain), enhancing accountability and reducing opportunities for corrupt practices.

## **The Internet as a Decision-Making Engine**

The Internet has already disrupted many outdated institutions—media, finance, even education. But it has yet to **truly replace governance**. Cypherpunks see the Internet not just as a communication tool, but as an **engine for collective intelligence**, where societies can make **faster, fairer, and more accountable decisions** than any bureaucratic system ever could.

Some emerging models include:

- **Liquid Democracy:** A hybrid between direct and representative democracy, where people can vote on issues directly or delegate their vote to trusted experts in real time.
- **Prediction Markets:** Online systems where people put **money where their mouth is** on political or economic outcomes, often proving more accurate than bureaucratic decision-making. This is because it creates an **incentive structure** for the debaters to be correct, in that they will benefit economically from being correct—unlike the bureaucracy, which collects a fixed paycheck regardless of performance.
- **Peer-to-Peer Governance:** Systems where communities self-organize through encrypted communication, without reliance on state-run bureaucracies. These can help us realise 'Covenant Communities', an emergent feature of high-trust, weak-state societies as discussed by Hans Herman Hoppe.

In contrast to **bureaucratic stagnation**, where decisions take months or years to process, these models allow **instant, scalable, and merit-based decision-making**—cutting out the middlemen who slow progress.

## **A Future Without Bureaucracy?**

In this whole piece, the caveat is 'energy'. All the processes stated above will be energy intensive and computationally expensive at scale. And that's a good thing. This is what I envision as a better outcome from the expansion of energy production and consumption—to take our civilisation to Type 2 on the Kardashev Scale.

Bureaucracy is, at its core, a relic of the **pre-fast Internet era**—an obsolete model for a world that now has the tools to function without it. **Cypherpunk technology offers the keys to bypassing bureaucratic parasites**, shifting power from slow, corrupt institutions to **efficient, decentralized digital networks**.

The question is not whether bureaucracy will collapse—it is **how long it will take for cryptographic systems to replace it**. If we succeed, the future will not be governed by sluggish bureaucracies, but by **code, cryptography, and collective intelligence—fast, transparent, and unstoppable**.
