# The Man, The Bureaucracy, The Internet and Bitcoin

There are 2 definitions to Bureaucracy.

Bureaucracy, as a system of administration, emerged as human societies became more complex and needed efficient ways to manage resources, regulate activities, and maintain order. Its development can be traced back to the rise of early civilisations and the growth of centralised states, as these societies faced increasing demands for coordination and organization. 

Bureaucracy is the silent conqueror of civilizations. It does not seize power through revolution, war, or economic domination. Instead, it infiltrates, expands, and slowly consumes the very ruling classes it once served. No matter who rules—priests, warriors, merchants, or secret police—bureaucracy latches onto the system like a parasite, feeding off its power while offering the illusion of order and efficiency. It's a hidden cost that the masses have to pay to be under the disguise of this illusion, by their freedoms, sweat and blood.

I want to argue both are true. Or 'were'. Because as of 2025, we are definitely closer to the latter than the former.

So, at the start of the Bureaucracy, various ruling classes presided over their societies, they came into power due to various external and internal factors including, but not limited to the Geography, Culture, Resource Availability, Complexity of the Civilisation and Competition, this is nicely detailed in a later section by Niccolò Machiavelli. These ruling classes supplanted their characteristic on Society in different ways. This is the primary reason for the demarcations of different human civilisations in the pre-modern age. These ruling classes included : 


Default Ruling Classes : 
The Priest / The Intellectual Class
The Warrior Nobility
The Merchant Class

Transitional Ruling Classes :
The Nomad Elites
The Peasantry
 
Emergent Ruling Classes : 
The Secret Police
The Hybrid

# **How Power Structures Shape Ruling Classes**

Power and ruling classes are intertwined, each shaping and reinforcing the other. As power structures shift, so too do the elites who hold control. From the priestly intellectuals of the past to the secret police of the modern era, each ruling class aligns with a particular type of power—whether it be ideological, economic, military, or informational.

---

## **The Default Ruling Classes**

### **The Priest / Intellectual Class – The Architects of Ideology**

At the heart of civilization lies ideology—the stories we tell ourselves about power, legitimacy, and the right to rule. Priests and intellectuals have historically controlled this narrative, shaping the moral and philosophical foundations of their societies.

In medieval Europe, the Church was not just a religious institution; it was a pillar of governance. It controlled education, dictated laws, and justified the rule of kings through divine right. Even in secular societies, intellectual elites—university professors, philosophers, and media figures—hold tremendous sway by shaping public discourse.

The intellectual class dominates through **ideological power**—they define what is acceptable, what is taboo, and what is unthinkable. In modern times, they manifest as think tanks, universities, and the media, exerting power over what people believe and, by extension, how they behave.

Example : Sumerian City States, the ruling governor or king came from the line of Priests and also held the rank of the Head Priest, also known as "Ensi" at Lagash. Brahmins in Ancient India.

This essentially leads to a Theocratic Authoritarianism if taken to the extreme.

### **The Warrior Nobility – The Enforcers of Violence**

Where ideology constructs the framework of power, violence enforces it. The warrior nobility—whether feudal knights, samurai, or generals—have historically wielded political power through military dominance. They are the lions of Machiavelli’s dichotomy: rulers who maintain order through force.

During times of instability, the warrior class often seizes direct control. However, in stable societies, they tend to be subservient to the ideological elite. Modern military leaders rarely take power outright, as they are ideologically conditioned to see themselves as defenders of the state rather than its rulers. This shift marks the transition from lion-led societies to fox-led ones, where controlled violence serves the interests of the bureaucratic and ideological elite.

Example : Franco's Spain, Modern Day Myanmar.

This essentially leads to a Military Junta or a Right Wing Coalition Authoritarianism if taken to the extreme.

### **The Merchant Class – The Masters of Money**

Money is a peculiar form of power—it can influence, but it is also dependent on external conditions. The merchant class, rising to prominence in the late medieval and early modern periods, thrives in societies where commerce is prioritised over military conquest or religious orthodoxy. They also gain prominence in peace times where chaos isn't as big of a factor.

In capitalist societies, the merchant class becomes dominant by leveraging **financial power**—controlling resources, production, and access to economic prosperity. However, wealth alone does not always translate to ultimate control. While capitalists influence policy through lobbying, media ownership, and philanthropy, they often remain secondary to those who control ideology.

In the modern world, billionaires fund politicians and media networks, but their power is often contingent on public perception. If the ideological elites turn against them, they can be brought down through regulation, social movements, or public scandal. This shows the limits of financial power when pitted against ideological control.

Example :  The British East India Company, Italian City States - Venice and Genoa 

This essentially leads to a Corporatokracy, not to be confused with Corporatism if taken to the extreme. Against mainstream thought, I don't think this is the end of Austrian Economics.

## **The Transitional Ruling Classes**

### **The Nomad Elites – The Disruptors of Stability**

Nomadic elites emerge during periods of upheaval—barbarians at the gates, warlords in power vacuums, or revolutionary leaders reshaping the system. They are the great **disruptors of civilization**, often using raw violence or opportunistic alliances to rise to power.

Historically, figures like the Mongols, the Bedouins, or the Cossacks exemplify this ruling class. They capitalize on periods of collapse, stepping into power vacuums left by failing institutions. Their rule, however, is often temporary—eventually, they either assimilate into the existing power structure or are replaced by more stable governance.

In modern times, nomadic elites could be seen in decentralized groups like terrorist organizations, insurgencies, or cybercriminal networks—entities that challenge the existing order but struggle to sustain long-term rule.

### **The Peasantry – The Accidental Rulers**

Rarely does the peasantry rule, but in moments of extreme crisis, they can rise to power. Peasant revolts, communist revolutions, and grassroots uprisings are examples of moments where the lower classes briefly seize control.

However, power gained through mass movements is often unstable. The peasantry lacks longterm institutional experience, making them susceptible to co-optation by ideological elites, military leaders, or bureaucratic administrators. The French Revolution, for instance, began as a peasant uprising but quickly fell under the control of the Jacobins and later Napoleon. The Vanguard, lead by the far left institutional class quickly sought to consolidate power away from the peasants after the revolution and had turned into a complete psychotic police state after Stalin got the reins of the state.

In modern politics, populist movements reflect this dynamic—while they claim to represent the common people, they are often guided by charismatic leaders who manipulate ideology for their own ends.

---

## **The Emergent Ruling Classes** (The Good, The Bad)

### **The Secret Police – The Masters of Information and Fear**

As societies become more bureaucratic and surveillance-driven, power shifts from visible rulers to those who control information. The secret police—whether in totalitarian states or through modern surveillance agencies—exemplify this shift.

Information power is distinct from ideological power—it is not about shaping belief but controlling behavior through **covert coercion**. The secret police don’t need to convince you of an ideology; they only need you to fear the consequences of dissent.

From the KGB to the Nazis, from intelligence agencies to corporate data surveillance, the new ruling class emerges not from the battlefield or the marketplace but from the ability to monitor, predict, and manipulate public actions.

The Secret Police State tries to end all manners of traditional institutions that formed the base for the traditional ruling classes - i.e Soviet Union tried to destroy the Family, the Church, Free Trade & Natural Rights, Culture and Heritage as to remove the semblance of any past, the Left will say its necessary to do so because, "All these institutions are inherently oppressive", when the real motive for the Secret Police State is to make sure that the Society can never go back to it's default, natural setting. This is the most dangerous of all and the seeds of cultural marxism, critical theory and social justice all lead to the same place. They are the ones who 1984 warns us of.

Here, there is no end goal. It's already here, and you wouldn't even know it. The dissenters will be vanquished, the protests will be not be visible, the words will be removed and rights will continue to be curtained, till there's none left, till there's no humanity, only replaceable cogs for the machine.

### **The Hybrid – The Synthesis of Power**

In a mature system, the most powerful ruling class is not a single entity but a fusion of multiple power structures. The "Hybrid" elite is a blend of competition between ideological, financial, and coercive forces, the intellectual, military, and economic spheres. This is when the Government keeps their nose out of the Economy, the Military out of the Administrative and the Religion keeps itself inside the house. I.e this is where you have the potential to do the most progress, most art and beauty, and most freedoms because of 'balance of powers' and the inherent understanding among everyone in these states that "Power Corrupts, and Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely".

Rome.
The Roman Republic featured a complex system where patricians (aristocratic elites), plebeians (commoners), and military leaders competed for power. Institutions like the Senate, Tribunes of the Plebs, and elected magistrates ensured a balance between these groups.

Medieval and early modern Britain.
They saw competition among the monarchy, the landed aristocracy, the Church, and later, a rising merchant class. The Magna Carta (1215) limited royal authority, empowering nobles and setting the stage for parliamentary governance.

Pre-Marxist Takeover America.
The U.S. Constitution established a system of checks and balances where political elites (elected officials), the judiciary, and economic interests competed for influence. Industrialisation in the 19th century saw the rise of powerful business elites ("robber barons"), but progressive reforms curbed their dominance. Military leaders also periodically shaped policy during crises (e.g., George Washington or Dwight Eisenhower).

---

The ultimate rulers are those who can adapt—who can subvert ideology with force and deceit, money with information and pander to the emotions of the masses with manipulation. 
As Machiavelli suggested, the ideal ruler is both a lion and a fox. And in our modern world, the ones who truly hold power are those who can wear both masks.

### **Lions and foxes**

Each of these sources of power works best under different conditions. Under conditions of anarchy, all the money in the world will not help you; if you are in a room with another person, and you have a million dollars while he has a gun. All your money will not give you an ounce of power and in all likelihood, he will exit that room leaving you without a single one of your million.

Information, ideology, and money are sources of political power that are dependent on there being some level of civilization because in a state of anarchy, there is only one inexhaustible source of political power and that, of course, is pure violence.

In contrast, in our civil societies, violence is used reluctantly and as a last resort in the form of the police and the army, but 99% of cases where political power is exercised, such as collecting taxes or granting permits, it is done without the need to use direct violence. So, we can say that the more orderly and, for lack of a better word, civilized a society is, the less that direct violence matters and the more information, ideology, and money matter.

So, if we want to know where power comes from, we first need to know what type of society we are looking at; if we are looking at Sudan, who is in the middle of a civil war between two warlords, we can say that power grows out of the barrel of a gun. While in our calmer societies, forming an armed militia will not get political power, but instead will alienate you and lead eventually to a stand-off with the police.

This actually correlates quite closely with one of the main ideas of the father of political science himself: Machiavelli. Niccolò Machiavelli stated that there were two types of rulers; the Lions and the foxes. 

The lions got their power from violence alone while the foxes get their power from intrigue and politics. In war-torn Sudan the foxes are practically useless, that is a land of lions, while in our calmer countries the opposite is the case; a lion is hopelessly outmatched in bureaucratic structures against the foxes.

We could even say that all civilisations experience a change from a ruling class made out of lions that forged the nation in some war of independence or conquest, to one made out of foxes that take over once that this society grows and establishes itself.

# **Bureaucracy and the Connection with the Ruling Classes** 

---
## **Bureaucracy and the Default Ruling Classes**

### **The Priest / Intellectual Class – The Ideological Justification for Bureaucracy**

Bureaucracy thrives under ideological rule because it **formalizes** power. The intellectual class, whether priests, scholars, or technocrats, needs an administrative machine to implement their vision. Without bureaucracy, their influence remains abstract—ideas alone cannot enforce laws, collect taxes, or regulate behaviour.

Religious institutions like the Catholic Church or Confucian civil service systems show how intellectual elites use bureaucracy to extend their control. However, bureaucracy is not loyal to ideology—it serves the system, not the ideals. Over time, it shifts from being a tool of the intellectual class to becoming a self-sustaining entity. The priestly elite may set the initial doctrine, but soon the bureaucrats are the ones deciding how that doctrine is interpreted, applied, and enforced.

Eventually, this leads to **institutional ossification**—where maintaining bureaucratic procedures becomes more important than the ideological mission itself.

_Example: The late medieval Catholic Church, where theological disputes became secondary to the maintenance of its sprawling administrative network._

### **The Warrior Nobility – From Command to Compliance**

Military rulers initially see bureaucracy as a necessity—a way to maintain supply lines, enforce order, and regulate conquered territories. But over time, bureaucracy **neuters** the warrior class.

Warriors operate on instinct, decision-making, and immediate action. Bureaucracy, by contrast, slows everything down with layers of approval, regulations, and administrative oversight. The warrior class, once the apex of power, finds itself entangled in a system where control is increasingly in the hands of clerks, advisors, and administrators.

In many historical cases, military elites are gradually displaced by bureaucrats who control logistics, governance, and taxation. **The sword rules at first, but the pen outlasts it.**

_Example: The transition from feudal samurai rule in Japan to the bureaucratic Tokugawa shogunate, where samurai became glorified government officials rather than warriors._

### **The Merchant Class – The Corporate Bureaucratic State**

Bureaucracy and the merchant class have a love-hate relationship. On one hand, bureaucracy facilitates trade by providing regulations, contracts, and stability. On the other, excessive bureaucracy stifles the free market, creating artificial barriers and inefficiencies.

In modern times, we see a fusion: **the corporate bureaucracy.** Mega-corporations now function as private bureaucracies, creating internal systems that are just as rigid and parasitic as state institutions. Business leaders may rise to power, but their companies become entrenched bureaucratic machines—slow, bloated, and resistant to change.

Ironically, the merchant class often **thinks** it controls bureaucracy, using lobbyists, regulations, and legal loopholes to its advantage. But in the long run, bureaucracy survives long after individual businesses collapse or markets shift.

_Example: The East India Company, which began as a merchant venture but evolved into a quasi-government with its own bureaucratic empire._

---

## **Bureaucracy and the Transitional Ruling Classes**

### **The Nomad Elites – The Enemy of Bureaucracy**

Nomadic elites thrive in conditions where bureaucracy has collapsed or is weak. They operate through **flexibility, improvisation, and informal networks** rather than rigid administrative systems. This makes them fundamentally opposed to bureaucratic expansion.

However, if a nomadic elite successfully seizes power, it must **either build a bureaucracy or be replaced by one.** The Mongols, for example, initially ruled through raw military force, but over time they adopted Chinese and Persian bureaucratic structures to govern their empire. The result? The Mongols were absorbed into the very civilizations they conquered.

This is the fate of all nomadic elites—if they don’t destroy bureaucracy, bureaucracy **domesticates** them.

_Example: The Mongol Empire, which went from an agile war machine to a bureaucratic ruling system that resembled the states they conquered._

### **The Peasantry – Bureaucracy as the New Aristocracy**

Peasant revolts and popular uprisings rarely destroy bureaucracy. Instead, they often **replace** one bureaucratic elite with another. Communist revolutions, for instance, claim to represent the working class, but the moment they seize power, they must create bureaucratic institutions to manage the economy, redistribute resources, and enforce party control.

The result? A **new class of bureaucrats emerges,** replacing the old aristocracy with a new administrative elite.

This is why peasant-led revolutions rarely lead to true classless societies. The state **expands** its bureaucratic apparatus, creating layers of managers, administrators, and enforcers who gradually become the new ruling class.

_Example: The Soviet Union, where a supposed dictatorship of the proletariat became a bloated, inefficient bureaucratic state._

---

## **Bureaucracy and the Emergent Ruling Classes**

### **The Secret Police – Bureaucracy as Surveillance**

The secret police represent a **hyper-bureaucratic form of power**—one that merges surveillance, record-keeping, and administrative control. Instead of directly ruling, they manage power **through data, intelligence, and control mechanisms.**

Totalitarian regimes often rely on bureaucratic surveillance systems rather than direct violence. Why? Because bureaucracy allows for **invisible control**—monitoring, regulating, and suppressing dissent before it manifests as rebellion.

This is the final evolution of bureaucratic power: rule through information rather than brute force.

_Example: The East German Stasi, which built a vast bureaucratic network to spy on citizens, controlling society without open repression._

### **The Hybrid – Bureaucracy is the Decadence of a Good System**

Modern states and corporations are no longer ruled by individuals, but by **institutional processes.** Politicians come and go, CEOs rise and fall, but the bureaucratic machine remains. It is self-replicating, self-sustaining, and largely immune to traditional forms of overthrow.

In a sense, bureaucracy **transcends ruling classes**—it is the **final parasite,** outlasting kings, generals, priests, and merchants. It does not need a face, a name, or an ideology. It simply expands, consumes, and perpetuates itself.

_Example: The modern administrative state, where elected officials often have less power than unelected bureaucratic institutions that dictate policy._

---
# **The Social Parasite: The Hidden Class of Extraction**

Every society is a delicate balance between those who create and those who consume. At the heart of this balance lies the **host-to-parasite ratio (HPR)**—the unseen measure of a civilization’s health. When the number of productive individuals, or **hosts**, outweighs the number of **parasites**, society thrives. When the parasites begin to overtake the hosts, decline sets in.

The **Social Parasite** is not just an economic freeloader—it is a broader category of individuals who take more from society than they give, whether through corruption, crime, or ideological manipulation. These are not simply the poor or unemployed, nor are they merely criminals. A parasite, by definition, is **not just someone in need, but someone who feeds off the system while actively contributing to its decay**.

### **Mexico: A Nation of Hosts and Parasites**

Mexico provides a textbook example of this dynamic. On one side, we see the **hardworking Mexican worker**, logging some of the longest hours in the world, deeply family-oriented, and contributing to an energetic and resilient culture. These are the **hosts**, the people who sustain society despite adversity.

On the other side, we find **the parasites**—not just the infamous drug cartels but also corrupt politicians, bureaucratic leeches, and cultural figures who normalize and glorify parasitic behavior. A striking example is the popularity of **narcocorridos**, folk songs that celebrate cartel life, spreading the idea that crime and parasitism are not only viable life paths but admirable ones.

The result? A country that **never collapses but never reaches its full potential**, constantly locked in a battle between its hosts and its parasites.

### **The Evolution of Parasitic Classes**

Social parasites adapt to the conditions of their societies. In some cases, they manifest as **ideological parasites**, shaping cultural values to excuse or glorify their existence. In others, they take on the form of **economic parasites**, siphoning wealth through corruption or manipulation.

But no matter their form, they share a common trait: they **do not contribute to the survival or success of their society but extract from it**. And if left unchecked, they eventually tip the balance—leading to a society where production declines, social trust erodes, and stagnation takes hold.

---
## **What to do?** 

Today, we stand at a place where the WORLD is increasingly more chaotic everyday, history's moving too fast - Curbing of our Rights, Wars, Technological Advancements and Brain Rot. Essentially, it's becoming difficult for the people and the parasites to deal with it. In our cultures, particularly many Eastern Cultures, Chaos is an enemy that must be defeated and tamed, that Order must be derived at all costs and **Uncertainty is something to be feared, not an opportunity to learn and progress to be seized.** No doubt, in the last 80-100 years of peace in the West, the inoculation of Cultural Marxism in all Institutions and psyche of the Masses, everyone is being taught to  give up their freedoms for the sake of this 'Order' and 'Common Good'. It's starting to reach a tipping point and it shows. There are cracks in the "Rules Based Order" i.e a psyop by Globalist Forces to extend and legitimise their Bureaucracy on all of us in the realm of Global Geo-Politics.

At the time of the writing, Romania's Right Wing Party has been banned and barred from Elections by the Bureaucracy. A party with 40% National Support banned by the Bureaucratic Puppets whose Ringmaster are sipping Champagne in Davos(WEF) and Brussels(EU). You have Italy, where the Mandate of the President elected by her peoples, is being limited by the supranational entity of EU. 

You have India, where a so-called Right Wing Nationalist Government cannot be fiscally responsible, only removes the power away from existing decentralised structures(including religious ones, which it claims to protect) by overextending it's surveillance state, by centralising more control every year, bring in draconian laws that does not care about the Rights and Liberties of her Citizenry as mandated by the Section 14 and 15 of the Constitution. What is so 'Conservative' or 'Right Wing' about this? As someone has said, "BJP is just Congress with Cows". Must ring true for all Gujaratis now that `Mota Bhai` has access to all your Data on your so-called Encrypted Social Media, in the name of Taxation. Make it make sense.  
 
The examples are endless and the frogs are starting to notice the brimming, boiling water. The Bureaucracy, as we know it today, is an artificial construct only existing because of a healthy amount of hosts partaking in their game. We have to tip this balance away to bring change. Each man checking out of the system is a lower HPR, lower the health of the civilisation, faster the change in the overtone window(I am going to discuss in the next article), greater the propensity to bring improvements by Organised Communities like ourselves. 

There are different strategies to deal with the 3 enemies within the masses itself (The faithless Bourgeoisie, the incessant Decadent and the Disposables) we will learn more about them later as as we go along this Crusade to cleanse our Civilisation and break the cycle. 

Right now, let's talk about something more personal and in our capacity to understand and work on. You should have this question, "Neo, if we remove Bureaucracy, in the ensuing Chaos, won't it be replaced by the same thing?"...and for most era, the answer would be Yes. However, today, we have extremely appropriate and frankly, divine material conditions to start taking consistent efforts to build away from this cesspool. Most people are sheep, but we must be better. That's the divine mandate given to the Masculine by our Gods. 

The Answer for our era is a resounding 'No'. Go back to the first paragraph of this piece, and in the first definition, the words I have used are carefully adapted to conjure up an entity that can effectively work upon the initial purpose of Bureaucracy, in a non-corruptible manner, i.e the Cypherpunk movement, the Internet and Freedom Tech can be the shot we need at this.

The Internet gives us the means to communicate and make community driven decisions without the need of a faceless Bureaucracy trying to relay message across(Often times, skewing said message), it can be a place of genuine debate where good ideas win and bad ones are rightfully trashed, unlike our current system where incompetences and mess-ups are rewarded at the peril of someone else's freedom or/and money. 

Then, you have the Cypherpunk Movement which is basically a Digital Rebellion Against Bureaucratic Decay.  This is a new force has emerged that challenges this decaying structure. Its' born from the belief that **privacy, decentralisation, and cryptographic tools can empower individuals**, the Cypherpunk movement offers more than just digital privacy—it provides the foundation for a new way of organizing society, one that **eliminates the need for bureaucratic middlemen and enables rapid, transparent decision-making via the internet**.

## **The Cypherpunk Vision: Replacing Bureaucracy with Digital Autonomy**

The **core problem** with bureaucracy is its nature as a **centralized bottleneck**. Every decision, from permits to policies, must pass through layers of slow-moving officials, each adding friction, delay, and often corruption. Cypherpunks propose an alternative: **using cryptographic systems to create trustless, decentralized decision-making networks**.

Rather than relying on bureaucrats to verify and enforce rules, cryptographic tools allow **automated, tamper-proof systems** that work without a central authority. This is already happening in:

- **Nostr:** A simple, open protocol enabling decentralized, censorship-resistant social media.
- **Smart Contracts:** Agreements that execute automatically based on predefined conditions, eliminating the need for regulatory oversight.
- **Bitcoin:** Effectively a non-inflatable currency, backed by the Energy Production capabilities of our Civilisation, held up by the Community.
- **Coinswap:** Bitcoin Transaction's privacy capabilities can be drastically improved with Coinswap.
- **Reticulum:** A low-level mesh networking protocol designed for resilient, decentralized communication, especially when traditional Internet infrastructure fails.
- **Decentralized Governance (DAOs):** Online organizations where members vote directly on proposals, bypassing traditional bureaucratic layers.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** A way to verify information (like identity or eligibility) without revealing sensitive data, reducing paperwork and fraud.
- **Tor Network:** Tor facilitates anonymous web browsing by directing internet traffic through a worldwide overlay network, concealing users' locations and usage from surveillance and traffic analysis.
- **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard):** Cryptographic tool for secure communication, enabling users to encrypt data and create digital signatures.
...and much much more.

By **automating trust**, Cypherpunk technology replaces bureaucratic inefficiency with **real-time, transparent decision-making**.

How so? Cypherpunk technologies, such as Nostr, smart contracts, Bitcoin, Coinswap, Reticulum, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Zero-Knowledge Proofs, the Tor Network, and GNU Privacy Guard (GPG), collectively challenge traditional bureaucratic systems by picking apart every function that it could have done. These innovations emphasize open-source development with permissive licenses, ensuring transparency and collaborative improvement. Features like self-hostability empower users to control their data, while the use of cryptographic public keys as user identifiers enhances security and privacy. Local-first applications operate without internet dependency, promoting resilience and user sovereignty. The principle of credible exit allows users to seamlessly transfer their data across platforms, reducing vendor lock-in. Self-authenticity ensures data integrity through cryptographic signatures, eliminating the need for centralized verification. Collectively, these technologies and principles dismantle bureaucratic inefficiencies, thus fostering a more autonomous and transparent digital ecosystem.

For example, Bureaucratic control over monetary systems has historically facilitated the expansion of fiat currencies, central bank mismanagement and bailing out of Corporations at the dime of the Taxpayer, leading to inflationary pressures, economic instability and breakdown of trust. Central banks, often influenced by political agendas, can increase the money supply without corresponding economic growth, resulting in currency devaluation thus making everyone poorer overtime excluding the ones closest to Power. Economist Murray Rothbard criticized this practice, equating excessive money creation to "legalized counterfeiting" and advocating for a return to the gold standard to maintain monetary integrity.

We talked about 3 problems posed by the Traditional Central Banking System. Freedom Tech like Bitcoin fixes these propped up by the Bureaucratic interventionist powers and offers an community based alternative
- **Fixed Supply:** Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins, preventing arbitrary expansion and protecting against inflation.
- **Community Driven:** Operating on a peer-to-peer network without central authority, Bitcoin reduces the potential for bureaucratic manipulation of the currency.
- **Transparency:** All transactions are recorded on a public ledger (blockchain), enhancing accountability and reducing opportunities for corrupt practices.

## **The Internet as a Decision-Making Engine**

The internet has already disrupted many outdated institutions—media, finance, even education. But it has yet to **truly replace governance**. Cypherpunks see the internet not just as a communication tool, but as an **engine for collective intelligence**, where societies can make **faster, fairer, and more accountable decisions** than any bureaucratic system ever could.

Some emerging models include:

- **Liquid Democracy:** A hybrid between direct and representative democracy, where people can vote on issues directly or delegate their vote to trusted experts in real time.
- **Prediction Markets:** Online systems where people put **money where their mouth is** on political or economic outcomes, often proving more accurate than bureaucratic decision-making, this is because it creates an **incentive structure** for the debaters to be correct, in that, they will benefit economically from being correct unlike the Bureaucracy who will get to collect a fixed paycheck regardless of the job they do.
- **Peer-to-Peer Governance:** Systems where communities self-organize through encrypted communication, without reliance on state-run bureaucracies. These can help us realise 'Covenant Communities', an emergent feature of High-Trust, weak State Societies which Hans Herman Hoppe talks about. 

In contrast to **bureaucratic stagnation**, where decisions take months or years to process, these models allow **instant, scalable, and merit-based decision-making**—cutting out the middlemen who slow progress.

## **A Future Without Bureaucracy?**

In this whole piece, the caveat is 'Energy'. All the processes stated above will be energy intensive and computationally expensive at scale. And that's a good thing. This is, what I envision, a better outcome of expansion of energy production and consumption to take our civilisation to type 2 on the Kardashev Scale.

Bureaucracy is, at its core, a relic of **pre-fast internet era**—an obsolete model for a world that now has the tools to function without it. **Cypherpunk technology offers the keys to bypassing bureaucratic parasites**, shifting power from slow, corrupt institutions to **efficient, decentralized digital networks**.

The question is not whether bureaucracy will collapse—it is **how long it will take for cryptographic systems to replace it**. If we succeed, the future will not be governed by sluggish bureaucracies, but by **code, cryptography, and collective intelligence—fast, transparent, and unstoppable**.
